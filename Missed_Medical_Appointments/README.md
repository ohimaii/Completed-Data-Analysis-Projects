Project: Investigating Medical Appointments Scheduling in Brazil

Problem Statement

"The purpose of this project is to investigate a dataset containing records of scheduled medical appointments in Brazil. The goal of the project is to understand how certain factors could possibly affect whether or not people show up for scheduled appointments. We focus on some variables of interest to help us achieve our set goal.

At the end of this project, we will to be able to answer the following questions:

How does gender affect number of appointments missed?
Do patients who receive the Bolsa Fam√≠lia Scholarship tend to show up to more appointments than patients who do not?
How do Hypertension patients tend to respond to medical appointments?
Do patients who have one or more SMS messages sent to them tend to show up to more or less appointments than patients who do not?
How does Scholarship affect male and female missed appointment rates?
How do SMS reminders affect the missed appointment rates of Hypertension patients?"
